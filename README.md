# Number_Sorter

In this number sorter project, you'll learn how to implement and visualize different sorting algorithms like bubble sort, selection sort, and insertion sort â€“ all with JavaScript.

This project will help you understand the fundamental concepts behind these algorithms, and how you can apply them to sort numerical data in web applications.
